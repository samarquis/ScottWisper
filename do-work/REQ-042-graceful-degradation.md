# Graceful Degradation Patterns

## What
Implement graceful degradation patterns for non-critical functionality failures.

## Why
Component failures should not crash the entire application.

## Detailed Requirements
- Design and implement graceful degradation patterns.
- Implement fallback mechanisms for non-essential features.
- Add user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions.
- Goal: Maintain core functionality even when 50% of non-critical services fail.

## Context
Imported from beads issue ScottWisper-h75d.
