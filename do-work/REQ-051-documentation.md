# Documentation Improvements

## What
Add missing documentation and improve code comments across the codebase.

## Gaps Identified
1. **Missing XML Documentation**: Most public methods lack summary tags.
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Service interaction patterns and data flows are unclear.
3. **Setup/Deployment Documentation**: Local development setup and production deployment steps are incomplete.
4. **Code Comment Quality**: Complex business logic and security implications are not noted.

## Detailed Requirements
1. Add XML comments to all public methods and classes.
2. Create architecture overview documentation (ADRs).
3. Document service contracts and interfaces.
4. Create a Developer Setup Guide.
5. Add performance and security documentation.

## Context
Imported from beads issue ScottWisper-p22i.
