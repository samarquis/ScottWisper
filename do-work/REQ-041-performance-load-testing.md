# Performance and Load Testing

## What
Add a performance and load testing suite with automated regression detection.

## Why
Performance regressions can go unnoticed without systematic testing.

## Detailed Requirements

- Add automated performance baseline comparison.
- Implement scalability testing.
- Goal: Validate system behavior under expected load and identify performance bottlenecks.

## Context
Imported from beads issue ScottWisper-0wvm.
