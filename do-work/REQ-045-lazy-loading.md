# Lazy Loading

## What
Implement lazy loading and deferred initialization for non-critical application components.

## Why
Eager loading of all components increases startup time and memory usage.

## Detailed Requirements
- Implement lazy loading patterns for non-essential features.
- Add deferred initialization for optional components.
- Implement smart preloading based on usage patterns.
- Goal: Achieve 40% reduction in startup time while maintaining responsiveness.

## Context
Imported from beads issue ScottWisper-hfv6.
