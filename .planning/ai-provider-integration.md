# AI Provider Integration Feature Request

## User Requirement
Allow users to connect their existing AI subscriptions as speech recognition providers instead of requiring OpenAI Whisper API.

## Target Providers
- **GitHub Copilot** (Work subscription)
- **Microsoft Copilot** (Personal subscription)
- **OpenAI Whisper API** (Default fallback)

## Implementation Considerations
- Provider selection in settings UI
- API key/authentication management
- Cost tracking per provider
- Fallback mechanisms
- Speech-to-text capability comparison

## Phase Placement
This feature should be added in Phase 2 (Windows Integration & User Experience) as it enhances the settings management and provider flexibility after the core pipeline is working.
