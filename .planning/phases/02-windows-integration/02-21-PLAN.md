<task type="auto">
  <name>Complete settings system validation and documentation</name>
  <files>SettingsService.cs, SettingsWindow.xaml, README.md</files>
  <action>
Finalize settings system with comprehensive validation:
1. Test all settings persistence and loading scenarios
2. Validate secure storage of encrypted API keys
3. Test settings migration between versions
4. Validate real-time settings application without restart
5. Test settings backup, restore, and reset functionality
6. Add user guide documentation for configuration
7. Validate accessibility and usability of settings interface

Settings validation:
- All settings persist correctly across restarts
- Encrypted data remains secure and accessible
- Settings apply immediately where possible
- Invalid settings are rejected with helpful messages
- Default settings provide good out-of-box experience
- Settings UI is accessible and user-friendly

Documentation updates:
- Complete user guide for all configuration options
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Performance tuning recommendations
- Security best practices documentation
- Integration instructions for enterprise deployment

Accessibility and usability validation:
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Keyboard navigation verification
- High contrast mode testing
- Font scaling and DPI testing
- Color contrast compliance
- User experience validation with diverse users
