<task type="auto">
  <name>Perform cross-application compatibility testing</name>
  <files>IntegrationTests.cs, TextInjectionService.cs</files>
  <action>
Execute extensive compatibility testing across Windows applications:
1. Test text injection in web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Validate integration with development tools (Visual Studio, VS Code)
3. Test Office applications (Word, Outlook, Teams, OneNote)
4. Validate text editors (Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom)
5. Test communication tools (Slack, Discord, Teams)
6. Add specialized application compatibility modes
7. Create application-specific fallback mechanisms

Target applications:
- Web browsers: address bars, search fields, text areas
- IDEs: code editors, terminal windows, search boxes
- Office: document editors, email composers, chat windows
- Text editors: various text input controls and dialogs
- Communication: chat interfaces, message composition
- System tools: Run dialog, search, file names

Compatibility features:
- Application detection and automatic mode switching
- Special character handling for different text controls
- Unicode support across various text encodings
- Performance optimization for specific applications
- Error recovery and retry logic for problematic applications

Test scenarios:
- Text injection in different control types within each application
- Special character and Unicode text testing
- Performance measurement for injection latency
- Fallback mechanism activation testing
- Application compatibility mode validation
- Error handling and recovery testing
